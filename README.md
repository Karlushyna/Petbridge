# PETBRIDGE

Welcome to the Petbridge Web App project! This repository contains all the code and resources needed to develop a web application that helps connect homeless pets with loving families.

## Project Overview

Our mission with this project is to create a user-friendly web application that allows users to search and browse homeless pets available for adoption. This platform will enable animal shelters and rescue organizations to showcase their animals and help potential adopters find their perfect furry companion.

## Features

- Pet Search: Users can search for pets based on criteria like location, species, age, and breed.
- Pet Listings: Display detailed information about each pet, including photos and descriptions.
- Adoption Process: Provide guidance on the adoption process, including application forms and contact details for shelters.
- User Profiles: Allow users to create profiles, save favorite pets, and track adoption status.
- Shelter Management: Shelters can manage their pet listings and update pet availability.
